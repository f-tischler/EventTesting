# Event Testing 

Writing test code for event-driven APIs in C# involves a lot of boiler plate code which obfuscates tests. This library intents to alleviate this problem by provding a fluent programming model for verifying event invocations and valdidating event arguments. It also supports use cases where events may be fired asynchonously with some delay by allowing to specify a timeout for the invocation verification.
